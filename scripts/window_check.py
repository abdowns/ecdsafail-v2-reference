"""The high word's top borrow written straight onto its target (TOP_BORROW_DIRECT), the lazy
window as one cell (LAZY_CELL) and the second strip's bit kept as the lazy tick's junk
(STRIP_BIT_JUNK) and the short counter step (COUNT_SHORT), as gates.

    python -I -B scripts/window_check.py

A whole high word writes its top borrow E onto g1 with the ladder's last CCX. A lazy window's ladder
writes it onto p, the pending borrow, and then takes g1 ^= (p ^ E) s, which is E s because p s = 0
when the tick reaches its high word: a pending p means the word has a bit above the window. With
LAZY_CELL the window is not a ladder at all but a fixed list of gates with 6 CCX, the same map on
the window's domain:
  U's two bits or V's are 0; z is 1 beside bits of U's, 0 beside bits of V's;
  zg = g0 z; g1 = 0; cw, g0 and s are free while p = 0;
  a set p comes with s = 0, z = 0, U's bits 0 and V's bits both 1 (cw and g0 free).

1. The cell against the ladder (both switches off) on every point of that domain, 68 of them:
   every wire must agree. The cell must have 6 CCX and touch no scratch wire, and every one of its
   gates must be needed: dropping any one gives a wrong point.
2. The domain is what the gates see. At the primes below marked with a count, M is run as gates on
   every x with a marker in front of each lazy window, and every tuple the window finds on the
   forward pass must be in the domain. The run counts the tuples with p set.
3. For each (prime, LAZY_END) below M and its inverse must give y*x and y/x, with x kept and every
   other wire 0: with every switch on, with each one off alone (forward), and with all off. The lanes
   are every x in 1..q-1 at the primes up to 17 bits, and lag_check's sampled inputs at the larger
   ones, each against y in 1, 2, q - 1 and one more (1 and q - 1 from 15 bits up). A pending borrow is rare: no x sets p at the
   primes just under a power of two, and hundreds do at the ones just above, so five of those are
   here; the run counts, from model_check's arithmetic model of p, the inputs that set p and those
   that reach a later high word with it set.
   Controls, which must give bad lanes on every build that has the gate:
     cell k     the cell without its k-th CCX, k = 1 .. 6: all six where some x sets p, five elsewhere
                (one of them only acts where a borrow stays pending); above 16 bits only k = 1
     no write   LAZY_CELL off: the lazy ladder's last CCX (onto p) is dropped
     no s       LAZY_CELL off: g1 takes p ^ E whole, a CX in place of the CCX with s (builds where p is set)
     no g1      a whole word's last CCX (onto g1) is dropped
   With STRIP_BIT_JUNK a lazy tick keeps b r on its junk wire, r the bit its second strip brings to
   the window's top, where it kept b p: the bit takes b p with one CCX and p loses b r AND NOT (the
   new bit) with another. Both only act under a pending p, so their controls must fail on every
   build where some x strips twice under one (counted from the same model), and the builds must
   also pass with the switch off:
     strip bit  the CCX that gives the bit b p is dropped
     strip p    the CCX that takes p r off p is dropped
   The junk wire itself is checked against model_check's junk model, which is b r there: the pass
   alone as gates, every x at the marked primes, must leave exactly the model's U, tape and junk.
   The run counts the inputs whose b r is set at some lazy tick (none at 1021 or 4093, the largest
   primes model_check.py runs the pass on), and the model with b p on that wire must not fit.
   With COUNT_SHORT the lazy counter's step writes its last carry straight onto the top bit, and a
   raw tick's step of two bits takes their majority with bit 0 as the carry. The builds must also
   pass with that switch off.
4. secp256k1 with the plan as built, on 500 of lag_check's inputs and on inputs that set p there:
   none of the 500 does, nor any hard case, but x = q - 2^j - r with a small r often does, so the
   run draws such x from a seed and keeps the ones the model says set p. 0 bad lanes, and on the
   kept inputs the cell without each of its CCX, the ladder controls no write and no s, and the
   strip controls must all fail.
5. _count alone as gates, on 1 to 8 bits, up and down, with one bit and with two: every register
   value against every step must give the sum, with the step bits kept and the scratch clean, in
   2 n - 3 CCX on n >= 2 bits; and up to 6 bits every gate must be needed.
